#Fake Reviews Detection

The prevalence of fake reviews poses a significant
challenge for online platforms that rely on reviews to inform
consumer decisions and for consumers who rely on the opinions
of other users to make decisions regarding buying a product.
To address this problem, various machine learning and natural
language processing techniques have been developed to automatically detect fake reviews. This project compares and analyzes
various supervised fake review detection techniques, including
traditional feature-based methods and modern machine learningbased approaches, such as deep neural networks. 2 types of
datasets - one where the fake reviews are generated using GPT2 [1] [2] and another where they are generated using back
translation (English - French - English) - are used. A comparative
analysis of various techniques involving traditional and modern
machine learning methods such as deep neural networks has
been made and their strengths and limitations are discussed in
detecting fake reviews. Logistic Regression and CNN + Attention
are some of the top performers among the variety of architectures
experimented with. A user interface that accepts input and
displays the model prediction is also developed.
